					<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenet Charles L. Dimaunahan was born on March 2, 1997 in Taysan, Batangas City. He is the second child of Franco and Ycel Dimaunahan. He also has an elder sister named Krystel.</p>		

					<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He finished grade school (2002-2009) and high school (2009-2013) in Our Lady of Mercy Academy, located in Taysan, Batangas. When he was in high school, he was part of both the chess and basketball varsity teams of his school. But after sometime of being part of two teams at the same time, his parents asked him to make a very tough decision - to choose only one between the two teams. Even if Kenet was given the chance to decide on his own, he still let his parentsâ€™ opinion influence his decision. He ended up choosing chess over basketball because his parents said that they think that he could make it big in chess and reach a high level. But up to this day, if given a chance, he said that he will choose basketball over chess anytime, anywhere and at any cause because according to him, it is his passion. </p>		

					<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kenet, now 19 years old, is currently a 3rd year Information Systems (IS) student in De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde in Manila. He took up IS because he believes that it will equip him with adequate skills in order for him to achieve his ultimate dream of becoming an application developer. Though far from his family and friends in Batangas, he tries his best to endure the helplessness and longing by hanging out with college friends, playing online games and playing basketball. He said that engaging in these activities make him feel a little less homesick every time. After all, he knows that the struggles he face being far from his family to study will eventually be worth it once he graduates and lands a job as an application developer.
