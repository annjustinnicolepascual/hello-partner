					About Kenet
					</h3>
					
					<p> I first met Kenet Dimaunahan during my first term in Benilde (2nd Term, SY 2014-2015). We were classmates in INCOSYS, but we never really had the chance to formally meet each other, and talk. We only knew each other’s names until last week when we were given this homework to make a website about each other. I asked Kenet about some of his personal information and education background to get to know him a little better. 

					Kenet Charles L. Dimaunahan was born on March 2, 1997 in Taysan, Batangas City. He is the second child of Franco and Ycel Dimaunahan. He has a sister named Krystel. He finished grade school (2002-2009) and high school (2009-2013) in Our Lady of Mercy Academy, also located in Taysan, Batangas. When he was in high school, he was part of both the chess and basketball varsity teams of his school. But after sometime of being part of two teams at the same time, his parents asked him to make a very tough decision - to choose only one between the two teams. Even if Kenet was given the chance to decide on his own, he still let his parents’ opinion influence his decision. He ended up choosing chess over basketball because his parents said that they think that he could make it big in chess and reach a high level. But up to this day, if given a chance, he said that he will choose basketball over chess because according to him, it is his passion. After finishing high school, Kenet decided to study college in Manila. He is currently a 3rd year Information Systems student in Benilde.  

					Apart from his education background, I also got the chance to ask Kenet about his top 5 dream destinations. The following are his top 5:</p>
